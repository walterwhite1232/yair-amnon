    <h1>Gibson Les Paul</h1>
    <p class="doodoo">The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar
        Corporation in 1952. The guitar was designed by factory manager John Huis and his team with input from and
        endorsement by guitarist Les Paul. Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and
        a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone
        controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.</p>
