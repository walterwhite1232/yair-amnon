    <h1>Telecaster</h1>
    <p class="doodoo">The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the tele /ˈtɛli/, is an electric guitar produced
        by Fender. Together with its sister model the Esquire, it was the world's first mass-produced, commercially
        successful solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke
        ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Many prominent rock musicians have
        been associated with the Telecaster for use in studio recording and live performances, most notably Bruce
        Springsteen, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Keith Richards and George Harrison.</p>
